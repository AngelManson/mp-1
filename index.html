                        My name is Angel Manson, I am a senior at Boston University
                        studying Computer Science with a Business minor.
                        With a lifelong passion for math, I have always known that
                        I wanted to work in a math-heavy field. So after high school,
                        I aimed for a career in Finance or Accounting, but a pivotal
                        moment came when I enrolled in a Computer Science course at
                        Boston University, urged by my mother. Instantly captivated
                        by the subject, I found myself thriving in the challenging
                        coursework, constantly feeling accomplished. This leap of
                        faith reshaped my career aspirations, revealing my true
                        passion for Computer Science. I am now driven to utilize
                        my mathematical passion and newfound love for technology
                        to make meaningful contributions within the field.
